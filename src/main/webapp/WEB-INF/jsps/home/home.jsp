<h1>Welcome to the Software Architecture Laboratory !</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Software architecture is now understood by many as the center
	around which the whole software development should be carried out for
	efficient development of high quality software. For that, however,
	there should be many accompanying methods and techniques that enable
	utilization of software architecture.</p>
<p>The central areas of interest of Software Architecture Lab,
	therefore, include practical and rigorous architecture description
	languages, analysis and reasoning techniques at the software
	architecture level and automation and verification methods for
	architecture-driven software development.</p>
